Progressive examples to help you learn TextTest

**Definition of ‘Koan’**  
 Kōans is a zen word meaning the enlightenment or awakening of a person, usually through a puzzle or riddle. The most common one is “What is the sound of one hand clapping?”

**What is this all about?**  
TextTest is a tool for automating black box testing of command-line programs.
These Koans are an interactive and fun way to be introduced to and learn how to test with TextTest.

**Current Lessons**
 
- Lesson1

**Getting Started**  
Download the zip, expand it
[install TextTest](http://texttest.org/index.php?page=documentation_trunk&n=install_texttest)
and then run texttest -a koans from the expanded directory.

Click on the first test, (top left) and follow the instructions and fill in the blanks

**Tips & Tricks**  
  
- *Play*: Experimentation is a powerful learning tool. Don't be afraid to try stuff out, and run it to see what happens.
- *Run the Test*: It is valuable to see what the results are. All Koans are designed to produce something even before they are filled in.
- *Debug*: Set some break point and walk thru the code. It's a great way to get details. ({"Ctrl+R, Ctrl+T"}) will run in debug mode.
- *Do Them with a Friend*: Learn is more fun and less fustrating when you have a friend with you.
- *Retrospect after each koan* True insight comes from reflecting on the answer, not just obtaining it. [Answer 1 question from this list](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.java.Koans/blob/master/Questions.md)
